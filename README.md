# ParserTDElena
Parser of 7 websites of clothing manufacturers to compare prices for similar products (TD Elena - base company)
This parser can be downloaded as a ready-made application for Windows. To do this, you need to download the win_parser_app_v.0.1.1.zip file and extract all the files, after which you need to run TDelena_price_parser.exe. The speed of the parser depends on the quality of the Internet connection. As a result of the Parser's work, the Result_in_CSV_format folder will appear in the application directory, where the .csv files with the parsing result will be located.
